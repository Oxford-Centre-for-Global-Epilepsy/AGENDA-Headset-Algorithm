# Dataset

This folder contains relevant codes for utilizing the dataset generated by Snakemake. They can be divided into following categories:

## Dataset Classes

- **eeg_dataset_rewrite.py**: provides the tensorflow dataset class that consumes the .h5 dataset
- **eeg_dataset.py**: provides a wrapper dataset class that re-uses original torch implementation

## Dataset Manipulators

- **dataset_merger.py**: provides the function that merges two dataset with removal of repeated subject (by comparing frequency content)
- **dataset_screener.py**: provides the function that cleans dataset with subjects whose recording is shorter than some threshold
- **test_prepare.py**: provides the function that draws a batch of EEG recordings, and stores in Teensy-consumable .csv files
- **validation_prepare.py**: provides the function that saves the isolated test set to the folder in .csv files

## Dataset Checkers

- **h5_inspect.py**: provides the function for quickly explore the structure of .h5 files
